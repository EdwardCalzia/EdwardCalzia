# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Edward Calzia and I am a student in London interested in Chemistry, Programming and Data Science. I love hackathons, and I enjoy creating solutions to problems using software as quickly and efficiently as possible. I am always looking to improve my skills and learn new things! I would love to hear from you so if you have any questions or comments please get in touch via my email or socials.
